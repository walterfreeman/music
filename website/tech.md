## Recording technology

In this class we will use several pieces of technology to take measurements, and many of your homework assignments will involve taking and analyzing measurements rather than writing stuff on a boring piece of paper.

I anticipate that most people will use smartphones and tablets running iOS or Android for most of this. I am better able to assist with Android (since I have an Android cellphone); I anticipate iOS users to be able to
pretty quickly figure out what they need, though. If you do not have a tablet or smartphone, please talk to me at office hours to get your laptop set up to make these sorts of measurements.

The apps we will be using most are:

* FFT Spectrum Analyzer (Android); free
* SpectrumView (iOS); free version, features unlockable for $10 (per Prof. Plourde)

You will need to be familiar with how to take screenshots with your smartphone and attach them to emails.

You will also want an audio recorder app for your smartphone; I believe most of them come with one, but I'm sure you can find one for free that just records sound clips.

We will also be using a tool called Audacity, free for Linux, Windows, and OSX. 


## Communication technology

I will often use Google Forms as a mechanism to get information from you between classes.
