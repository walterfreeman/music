### Office hours

I've decided to hold office hours:

* Wednesday: 4:30-6:30, although today's might start a little late
* Thursday: 2:00-4:00

### Resources for today:

Here's a piano keyboard for reference:

Here's a <a href="https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano">virtual piano</a> you can play on your computer/tablet.


### After class today you should:

* Make plans to come to office hours if you want extra help with music-reading and piano-playing (for the nonmusicians),
or if anything today wasn't clear
* **Work on Homework 1**
* Read pages 29-46 of *Horns, Strings, and Harmony* -- a look back at what we've done from an older perspective
* If you get a chance: read pages 47-66 -- a look forward to what we will do next week.

### Today, we will:
  * Review the idea of "harmonics" and "overtones", since that came up last time
  * review how musicians talk about pitch, and talk about some basic music theory (as necessary based on your background)
  * talk about how pitch relates to frequency
  * review the mathematics of logarithms (since that's the answer to the last two...)
  * If we have time: talk about how the amplitude of a sound wave relates to its loudness, and introduce the decibel scale

* **Homework 1 is due Saturday, January 27**

### Next class, I hope to:

* Discuss where the harmonic series/overtones that we observe comes from in the first place
* Start our study of stringed instruments
