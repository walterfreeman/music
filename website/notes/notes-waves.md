Waves: do wavespeed = frequency * wavelength with computer demo, then have them do this with the wave tank (15 minutes)

   * Point out that frequency = 1 / period
   * Thus "distance = speed * time" -> "wavelength = wavespeed * time" -> "wavelength * frequency = wavespeed"
   * "If a hundred cars on the freeway pass you every hour, and they are driving a half-mile apart, how fast are they going?" -> 50 mph

Sound waves: what happens when the thing waving is the air itself. (3 minutes = 18)

What produces sound waves? -> oscillators: things that have a restoring force + inertia (5 minutes = 23)
  * Pendula
  * Guitar strings
  * Tuning forks
  
Show examples of waves of different waveforms and play them for the students -- "how do we sort all these out?" (5 minutes = 28)
  * Computer demo, but no Fourier yet
  * Recorded demo with digital piano

"Simple harmonic oscillator" -- the most basic kind there is, pendulum at low amplitude / mass bouncing from spring. Solution: sine waves (10 minutes = 38)
  * Draw diagram of restoring force vs. extension
  * Make a point that this is almost never the case
  * An aside for those who know calculus, *if* we have time: the DE

Fourier's Big Idea: *any* oscillation and *any* signal can be broken down into a sum of sine waves (15 minutes = 53)
  * Computer demo with the fourier-o-matic
  * "bright" sound -> lots of higher partials -> "complicated, angular" wave
  * "dark" sound -> few higher partials -> "simple, smooth" wave 

This, conveniently enough, is how we *hear*. We don't hear in the time domain; we hear in the frequency domain

Spectral analysis: asking what frequencies are present: remainder of class (= 27 minutes)
