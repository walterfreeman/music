## Physics of Music final paper(s)

#### Due to me by email to wafreema@syr.edu by Thursday, May 10 (yes, this is very late -- giving you as much time as possible!)

As a final assignment, write a paper or papers (see below) that connect the practical side of music to the physical principles involved in creating it. I don't want you to
simply present mathematics or physics; I *also* don't want you to tell me only about how a particular thing sounds, or how you play a particular instrument. Rather, I want you
to address the bridge between the two. Tell me how technical, physical ideas are used in the design of musical instruments or performances -- or how they can be used to understand
why music works in the ways that it does.

I am looking for a total of 6-8 pages of space-and-a-half written work from each of you. (You may of course include spectrogram screenshots or any other figures that are relevant!) You may either:

* write one longer paper (see ideas below)
* write a shorter paper on one of these ideas. Additionally, attend a concert (there are many, many student performances all the time!), and write about the acoustics involved
in the performance.

If you do your own research, you should cite your sources in any clear way that you find convenient. If you want to reference recordings, YouTube links would be appreciated.

### Writing about a concert

If you attend a concert and write about it, you may choose to write about several different things. What you focus on will depend on what you found interesting and what sort of
show you attended. Regardless, however, you should discuss the connection between the *sounds you heard* and the *physics that produced them*. Some things you might address could be:

* What sort of room was the concert played in? Did it suit the instruments, players, and type of music?
* How do the performers' instruments work? What did you notice about them? Did their technique match what you know about the physics of their instruments?
* Did you hear anything unusual or notable? Did the performers do anything strange, or did the music itself include any acoustically interesting elements?
* If the concert involves multiple instruments, how do their sounds differ? Do the different timbres and frequency-spectrum characteristics of the instruments complement each other in an aesthetically-interesting way? 
What properties do they have in common, and how do they differ? 
    * Note: in a classical concert held in a formal setting, like Setnor Auditorium, it is bad etiquette to use your cellphone during a performance, even to run your spectrum analyzer. Pop/rock/jazz concerts probably don't care...




### Some possible paper topics

Here are some suggested topics. If you want to propose your own, feel free!

* Explore the "loudness wars" in some depth. Why were recording studios competing to make the "loudest recording"? How does that work? Discuss the tradeoffs involved in
making a recording "louder"; what is lost in the process? Discuss the trends in sound mastering of popular music from the 1970's to the present, referencing recordings (albums) that 
demonstrate those trends. Is there any interplay between trends in musical aesthetics ("what kind of sound are we going for?") with the techniques used to make recordings and in the
technology used to listen to them? If you want to discuss any recordings that you have a copy of, you might import them into Audacity and take screenshots.

* Advances in musical technology are often driven by the changing desires of performers and composers: a composer wants a new sound, the technology doesn't exist yet, so they create it.
Research the evolution of tuning systems in European music and its coevolution along with music theory. Specifically, during the medieval period (pre-1400 or 1450), Pythagorean 
temperament was most common. Starting in the Renaissance (in the early 1500), musicians began to favor mean-tone temperament. Then, in the late Baroque / early Classical period (around
1750), equal temperament came to dominate.<br>
Explore the interplay between advances in music theory and preferred tunings. As landmark composers from each period, you might consider Perotin or Machaut (medieval), Josquin
or Monteverdi (Renaissance/early Baroque), and JS Bach or Mozart (late Baroque/Classical).

* Research the history and evolution of either bowed string instruments (the violin and its cousins), plucked string instruments (the guitar and its cousins, including electric guitar),
brass instruments (the trumpet and its cousins), reed instruments, or stringed keyboard instruments (harpsichord, clavichord, and the various developments of the piano). Discuss:
    * What changes have these instruments gone through in history?
    * What desires of performers and composers motivated these changes? (Were they trying to make instruments easier to play, make them sound louder, extend their range, or what?)
    * What are the physics behind the changed designs? Physically, how does the design of the instrument relate to its sound and playing properties?

* The electric guitar has been used to produce an enormous variety of sounds. Choose a set of guitarists and discuss their unique sound and how they achieved it, whether that is in
the design of their instruments, details of their playing technique, electronic signal processing, or particular designs of amplifiers. Illustrate your examples with specific recordings
where appropriate. Also discuss the musical uses they found for their signature sound.

* Discuss the relationship between performance spaces, the types of challenges that performers in those spaces face, and the styles of music that are most often performed there.
How are performance spaces adapted to fit music, and how is music adapted to fit performance spaces? As some examples, you might consider large cathedrals (such as 
Notre Dame in Paris, St. Peter's in Rome, or St. John's in New York City); Carnegie Hall; the Metropolitan Opera in New York City or other opera houses; Syracuse Symphony Hall or 
other symphony halls; smaller churches; the large stadiums such as the Carrier Dome that are used for rock concerts; and informal performing spaces such as bars and the like where
jazz and rock are often played.

* Choose a musical recording that has unusual characteristics -- in the playing techniques used by the musicians, the instruments they are playing, the composition
of the music, the recording techniques, the mastering used to edit the recording, etc. Discuss in detail the relationship between the choices made by the performers/composers/recording
engineers and the sound that is produced: what do the musicians do in order to achieve their goals, and what are the physics involved? This project is most appropriate for modern
recordings that break new ground (whether in popular music, classical music, jazz, etc.) or those that use substantially unusual techniques. Whatever you choose, your paper should discuss
the connection between the sound the performers achieve and the physics that creates it. This could include, for instance:
    * Modifications to the usual sounds of instruments (electric guitar pedals and effects, prepared piano, etc.)
    * Unusual mastering or processing techniques (distortion, compression, etc.)
    * The fusion of electronic music techniques with classical styles in modernist music
    * The fusion of classical music ideas with rock/metal (use of electric cellos in Apocalyptica, etc.)
    * The use of primitive synthesis for effect in modern music (from Machinae Supremacy and others)

* Explore the history of video game music from the earliest synthesis techniques on the Amiga and NES to the use of fully-recorded music in modern games. How have composers managed
to adapt their aesthetic and art to the changing technology available? How have they pushed the limits of the capability of the technology available? 
One interesting set of recordings (by the same composer, Nobuo Uematsu) to consider might be
    * *Final Fantasy I*, demonstrating the primitive square/triangle-wave synthesis of the original NES
    * *Final Fantasy VI*, using primitive MIDI-style synthesis on the Super Nintendo, but pushing the boundaries with an attempt to create an opera scene
    * *Final Fantasy VII*, using more advanced MIDI-style synthesis on the Playstation, but melding this with recorded voices in the famous track *One-Winged Angel*
    * *Xenosaga* (by Yasunori Mitsuda), consisting of traditional recordings, but retaining musical influences from the genre's roots in synthesis<br>
You may, of course, write about any other sequence of developments in this period that you find interesting. 

* (Intended especially for physics and engineering majors) Explore similarities between acoustical phenomena and those in other fields of physics. How do the things you have learned
in this class relate to those in optics, electronics, or quantum mechanics? What parallels have you found? Have they brought you greater insight into any other fields of physics?
How do acoustical wave phenomena differ from those commonly found in other disciplines?
