Intro music (Cantata in memoriam)
Jiaxin's presentation
If she did a good job: move on to decibel stuff
Things that should be mentioned if she omitted them:

- stick-slip mechanism diagram
- mechanics of air-cavity resonance
- violin body as an air cavity: the f-holes and the generated air resonance
- wood resonance -- these two are tuned to D4 and A4
- other wood resonances provide many additional peaks
- complex vibrations of instrument body affect radiative efficiency at high frequencies; measure formant of Jiaxin's
- other instruments -- bigger dimensions, lower resonances
- pizzicato playing technique
