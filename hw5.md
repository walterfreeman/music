## Mechanics of Brass Instruments 

### Due Wednesday, April 18, in class

Recall from class that a trombone with the slide "all the way in" (in first position) has as its lowest note B-flat 1, two octaves and a whole step below middle C.


1. Without moving the slide, what are the first eight notes that can be played on the trombone, just by changing the player's embouchure? What is the physical reason that the trombone can play only *those* particular notes in first position?

2. Extending the slide adds some length to the tube, lowering the pitch of the instrument. Trombone players identify six more positions ("second position" through "seventh position"),
with each successive position playing a note one half-step lower than the previous one. How much longer is the tube inside a trombone in seventh position than it is in first position?

3. Consider the note F3 (F below middle C). Is it possible to play this note in more than one way?

4. Discuss how a trombonist plays all of the notes from E2 (one line below the bass clef) up to E4 (E above middle C). You don't have to discuss each individual note, but describe the pattern used to play all these notes.

5. Noting that the trombone rarely plays notes below E2, is there any reason why a trombone slide only has seven positions? Why don't instrument-builders make larger slides? Wouldn't this add more flexibility to the instrument?

6. A bugle is a brass instrument without a slide or valves that is played only with the musician's embouchure; there is no other mechanism to change its pitch. It is often associated with the military, and various tunes played
on the bugle are used as signals to soldiers. A famous tune played on the bugle is "Reveille", used to wake them up in the morning.

Based on this score, what do you think is lowest note that this bugle can play, and why?
