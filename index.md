title: Welcome to Physics of Music!
---

After class today you should:

* Pick some people you'd like to work with on Homework 1
* Exchange contact information and find each other on Facechat or Snapbook or InstaMe or whatever your preferred meme-delivery platform of choice is
* Go look at the Google Forms that you need to fill out by Saturday

Upcoming agenda:

* On January 17 (today), we will:
  * introduce the class and each other
  * make some decisions about what this class will be and how it will be graded
  * talk about what we will do in here
  * talk about what waves are (hint: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NxLh-3DdaE">they</a> do it better than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gsw11qeKM4">us</a>, but we're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4XzLDM3Py8&feature=youtu.be&t=92">pretty good too</a>
  * talk about the properties that waves have
  * talk about what it means that sound is a wave
  * generate some sounds and play with them!

* **Homework 0 is due Saturday, January 20**

* On January 22, we plan to:
  * talk about people's submissions for the "what do you want out of this class?" and make further plans
  * discuss what a "simple oscillator" is and why sine waves are special
  * discuss how it's possible to break *any* sound into pure sine waves, and why this is immensely valuable to do
  * discuss spectroscopy and make sure everyone is set up to do Homework 1

* On January 24, we plan to:
  * review how musicians talk about pitch, and talk about some basic music theory (as necessary based on your background)
  * talk about how pitch relates to frequency
  * talk about how the amplitude of a sound wave relates to its loudness, and introduce the decibel scale
  * review the mathematics of logarithms (since that's the answer to the last two...)
  * discuss the field trip we will hopefully take on January 29 to learn about our first musical instrument -- the great granddaddy of them all!

* **Homework 1 is due Saturday, January 27**

* On January 29, I hope to:
  * Take you all on a trip to meet the largest musical instrument on campus, learn how it works, and measure its properties!
