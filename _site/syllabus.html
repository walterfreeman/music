<h3 id="course-philosophy">Course philosophy</h3>

<h4 id="exploration-adventure-and-flexibility">1. Exploration, adventure, and flexibility</h4>

<p>This course will involve a great deal of exploration. We’ve not taught a course like this at Syracuse for a long time, and so you all are getting on the ground floor of a new 
course in development. So, if you have an idea for something you’d like to study, let me know; I want this class to be about what <em>you</em> want it to be about.</p>

<p>Likewise, to as great of an extent as possible, this is going to be a class where you all explore the science of sound and music actively, rather than sitting in class taking notes.
You will be playing musical instruments and making measurements of them, going to concert halls and concerts, and taking acoustic measurement equipment around campus and actually 
testing things. We will not always be meeting in the same room; this class will involve field trips (at least to Hendricks Chapel and Setnor Auditorium…)</p>

<p>Since this is a new class, and since you all will be doing so many things other than “coming to class and listening to me talk and boring”, 
some things may not go as intended,
and we may wind up needing to improvise. Additionally, you all have diverse backgrounds in the physical sciences, mathematics, and music, and you are likely hoping to get different
things out of this class. Thus, I appreciate your flexibility as we together make this class into what you all want it to be.</p>

<h4 id="interdisciplinary-approach">2. Interdisciplinary approach</h4>

<p>This course is taught in the physics department, but it is part of the College of Arts and Sciences – since “art” and “science” are not so different from one another.
In our course I hope to bring together the two practices, helping students with more of a science background understand the fascinating applications of their scientific 
principles on stage, and helping musicians understand the scientific principles behind the art that we all love. The aim is not to “meet in the middle” someplace, but
to create a broader perspective that weaves together the practical and artistic expertise of musicians with the analytical methods of physics.</p>

<h4 id="im-not-the-only-teacher-here">3. I’m not the only teacher here</h4>

<p>You all undoubtedly know lots of stuff I don’t, particularly about specific musical instruments that you play. <em>I want you to share that expertise!</em> As part of your grade,
everyone will need to lead a formal class discussion at least once, but aside from this – if we’re covering a topic that you are an expert in, or want to share your 
expertise about <em>anything</em> with the class, please do so.</p>

<h4 id="this-is-your-class">4. This is your class!</h4>

<p>As part of this philosophy, I welcome your input. If there is something you’d like to add to the curriculum that inspires or fascinates you, please ask; 
if you have feedback for me that will help you enjoy the class more, then please let me know.</p>

<hr />

<p><a id="material"></a></p>

<h3 id="course-material">Course Material</h3>

<p>Some of the topics we will likely cover are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The nature of sound itself
    <ul>
      <li>What does it mean that “sound is a wave”?</li>
      <li>The properties of sound waves</li>

      <li>Human hearing and microphones</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The biggest idea of the class: standing-wave resonance
    <ul>
      <li>Waves can be trapped in cavities like strings, organ pipes, drumheads, bells, etc.</li>
      <li>Those cavities allow vibrations only at certain special frequencies, determined by their shape</li>
      <li>The special “harmonic sequence” of the frequencies allowed in certain cavities…</li>
      <li>… and their relation to an important defect in human hearing, microphones, and speakers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some basic music theory
    <ul>
      <li>The Western system of pitch and musical notation</li>

    <ul>
      <li>What almost all musical instruments have in common:

          <li>They trap waves in a <em>cavity</em></li>
          <li>That cavity is <em>excited</em> by a reed, a bow, the motion of air, a player’s fingers, etc.</li>
          <li>The resulting sound may encounter a <em>resonator</em> that amplifies its sound or changes its <em>formant</em></li>

<p>However, the exact content of the class will be determined by <em>your</em> wishes, not by some preplanned script of mine.</p>

<p><a id="activities"></a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="course-activities-and-grading">Course Activities and Grading</h3>

<p><strong>Class participation:</strong> Your participation in class is exceptionally important in a small class like this. 
At a minimum, you are expected to come to class every day and actively participate in discussions. 
I may assign “warmup questions” – short questions that I ask you at the end of a day’s class 
and ask you to think about and answer via Google Forms before the next class as a starting point for discussion. 
These will be graded for effort, not correctness.</p>

<p>Class participation each day will be graded on an 0-3 scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0 = absent or not meaningfully participating</li>
  <li>1 = present, but participating only in a limited way, or substantially late</li>
  <li>2 = present and fully participating</li>
  <li>3 = exceptional contributions to the class</li>
</ul>

<p>A grade of 2 is “full credit”; a grade of 3 is extra credit.</p>

<p>Attendance will count double on days when students are giving presentations, in order to ensure that your classmates
benefit from a robust audience. (Those of us who are performers know how disappointing it is to sing for an empty house!)</p>

<p>Students missing class for medical or professional reasons should contact me in advance with an explanation to be given
an excused absence.</p>

<p><strong>Hands-on projects:</strong> During the semester I will ask you to do projects involving measuring things. 
Sometimes we will do this in class; sometimes we will do this by traveling somewhere (like Hendricks Chapel) as 
a group; sometimes these will be assigned for homework. These sorts of projects are a core part (and probably the most
fun part!) of the class.</p>

<p><strong>Homework:</strong> Sometimes I will assign homework to you that will be collected in class. This will take many
different forms, usually some combination of a few short questions answered by some combination of writing and 
(simple) mathematics.</p>

<p><strong>Office hours:</strong> Everyone is required to attend office hours at least twice during the semester and have some meaningful
conversation with me or someone else about the material. 
I hope you will come more often than that, of course!
Office hours are not just a time to show up when you need help; you are encouraged to come to office hours and do your 
work there, working alongside other students.</p>

<p>Office hours will be scheduled based on times that are good for you all; I can also meet with students by appointment, or
you can come find me in my office (room 215) or the Physics Clinic (room 112). Please contact me by email at any time.
If you’d like to talk to me on the phone when I’m not on campus, email me and I’ll send you my phone number if I’m free.</p>

<p><strong>Papers:</strong> I am going to assign two short (2-4 page) papers this semester. One will require you to attend a performance
and write about what happened in it; the other will be assigned at a later date, and the topic will likely be something we 
can customize based on your interest.</p>

<p><strong>Class presentations:</strong> Everyone is required to lead the class in at least one presentation on a mutually-agreed-upon
topic at some point in the semester. 
This might be a discussion of the nuances of the physics of an instrument that you play (involving a demonstration),
or a look into a particular topic that you are interested in. If you want to present more than once (if you play two
instruments that we’re going to talk about that nobody else plays), then you are welcome to do that as well.</p>

<p><strong>Exams:</strong> There will be one midterm and one final, along with sporadically-assigned short quizzes. For the final exam,
you have the option of taking a written exam or an interview exam; I encourage you to do the latter, since this allows
me to customize the topic to your personal goals and abilities.</p>

<p>After the midterm, you will have a chance to study the questions you missed and then come talk to me for an interview.
I will ask you questions to see if you’ve learned the material you didn’t know the first time around, and you will have
the opportunity to earn half of the points you missed back.</p>

<p><a id="grading"></a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Your final grade will be computed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participation: 20 points</li>
  <li>Hands-on projects: 30 points</li>
  <li>Homework: 20 points</li>
  <li>Papers: 20 points</li>
  <li>Midterm exam: 20 points.</li>
  <li>Final exam: 20 points</li>
</ul>

<p>Your score will be converted to a percentage and your final letter grade will be determined according to the following
scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>88-100 : A</li>
  <li>80-88  : A-</li>
  <li>75-80  : B+</li>
  <li>70-75  : B</li>
  <li>65-70  : B-</li>
  <li>62-65  : C+</li>
  <li>58-62  : C</li>
  <li>55-58  : C-</li>
  <li>50-55  : D</li>
  <li>under 50 : F</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><a id="late"></a></p>

<h3 id="late-submissions-and-class-absences">Late Submissions and Class Absences</h3>

<p>Students often ask about submitting work late. I want to try a new policy this semester that is designed to give you all
maximum flexibility with your work schedules and allow you to work around health issues, other classes, etc., while still
requiring that the bulk of your work is turned in on time.</p>

<p>Each of you has ten “late days” that you may use without penalty. That is, you may turn in two assignments five days late,
or five assignments two days late, etc., with no loss of credit. (In the case of 
late homework, I may ask you to have a short discussion with me to ensure that you understand the material and are not just
copying someone else’s work.) If you do want to turn something in late, please email me on the due date and let me know, as 
a courtesy, that you are late but that you are planning on doing the assignment. The first assignment won’t be accepted late,
since the survey about your background will be vital for me to plan the class going forward.</p>

<p>After you are ten days late turning things in, each day late will result in a loss of 25% credit for the assignment in question.
However, if you have a serious medical or personal issue that requires accommodation beyond what is provided by this policy,
please contact me and we’ll work something out.</p>

<p>This policy is in place in part to allow students with personal or medical 
challenges, or who must postpone work due to important religious or family commitments, 
the flexibility that they need to work around these issues, without disclosing them to me or 
feeling anxious about “needing to make excuses”. Just turn it in late and use your late-days. 
I would appreciate feedback about this policy from 
any students who have chronic physical or mental illness, as it is designed with your needs in mind.</p>

<p>If you miss class on a day when we have a quiz, you should come to office hours when you are able. After a short discussion in
which you demonstrate that you understand the material, you’ll get a grade for the quiz with no penalty; you may do this up to
twice.</p>

<p><a id="policy"></a></p>

<hr />
<h3 id="accommodations-for-disabilities-and-personal-challenges">Accommodations for disabilities and personal challenges</h3>

<p>I try to be quite accommodating of students’ medical, disability-related, and personal challenges.
If there is anything I can do to help you, whether it is related to a disability, a medical condition, or anything else, please let me know.</p>

<p>However, you <em>must</em> communicate with me; except for emergency situations, I will be much more flexible if I know in advance
what is going on than if you show up at the end of the term and let me know <em>then</em> why you’ve been missing class all term. (Of course,
this doesn’t apply to registered ODS students; I don’t need to know the details of your medical situation for me to provide accommodations
they request on your behalf.)</p>

<p>If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS)
at <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">disabilityservices.syr.edu</a>, located in Room 309 of 8047 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498, TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will issue students with documented Disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I have an excellent working relationship with ODS and will do anything in my power to make your experience in my class a good one.</p>

<p><strong>Incompletes:</strong> A grade of “incomplete” may be given to any student who is unable to complete the course material by to the end of the semester due to
unavoidable problems outside their control. This is a “grade pending” status that allows you to finish up the course in the future and then
receive a grade without having to retake the course or pay tuition again.
In general, any student who is unable to meaningfully participate in class for a period of two weeks or more due to</p>

<ul>
  <li>serious illness or injury, physical or mental;</li>
  <li>caregiving for the serious illness of a family member;</li>
  <li>legal involvement or proceedings;</li>
  <li>or international issues</li>
</ul>

<p>is eligible to take an incomplete in the course. If you think that you may need to take an incomplete, please contact me as soon as possible.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>

<p>While you are encouraged to discuss everything in the course (other than exams during the exam period) with your peers, all work you submit must reflect your own understanding. You are not allowed to communicate with or collaborate with anyone other than teaching staff during exams. Consulting a cellphone for any reason during an exam without permission will be considered presumptive evidence of
academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>You will often work on projects in groups. My expectation is that all group members will have meaningfully contributed to 
the work; by submitting a group project, you are certifying that you helped substantially in its preparation.</p>

<p>Your submissions must reflect your own understanding and work. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must show clearly which text is original to you, which reflects ideas which you found elsewhere but have digested and expressed in your own words, and which text is a direct quote from someone else’s words.</li>
  <li>You must cite any references that you use. If you consult a webpage or book for information, you should tell me this. I don’t care what citation style you use.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct quotes must be indicated</strong>, as must extensive near-direct paraphrases (i.e. taking the organization and content of someone else’s writing and merely replacing words with synonyms, reordering words, etc.).</li>
  <li>If I ask you to measure something, you must measure it yourself (or with a group of students of which you are a part). 
Submitting data that you didn’t actually measure (i.e. fabricating observations) will be treated as an extremely serious
offense.</li>
</ul>

<p>The boilerplate that the university provides to us:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place
on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students
accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility
to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations.
The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and
assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class
activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without
receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation
are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the
School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric.
Syracuse University students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity
expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term checkin

<p>The Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the determination
of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to select the grade penalty they
believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of violation level. Any established violation in this
course that entails substitution of someone else’s understanding for your own or academic dishonesty 
may result in course failure regardless of violation level.</p>

<h3 id="religious-observances">Religious observances</h3>

<p><em>(The following is common to all SU classes)</em></p>

<p>SU’s religious observances notification and policy, found at http://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/index.html, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented among the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holidays according to their tradition. Under the policy, students are provided an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance provided they notify their instructors before the end of the second week of classes. An online notification process is available for students in My Slice / StudentServices / Enrollment / MyReligiousObservances / Add a Notification.</p>

<p><em>(The following is specific to this course)</em>
I believe that SU’s religious observance policy discriminates against nonreligious people by privileging important religious observances over 
equally important secular events that happen in our lives.
Thus, events of equal solemnity to major religious observances, occurring on inflexible dates, will be given the same deference as religious observances.
This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of immediate family members, funerals, caregiving duties for sick family members, other family emergencies
or singularly-important events, job interviews, and the like. Note that I treat exceptionally close friends and romantic partners as family members.</p>

<p>If you need to miss class for such a reason, please notify me as far in advance as practical to discuss arrangements.</p>
