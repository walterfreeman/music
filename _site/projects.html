<h3 id="due-to-me-by-email-to-wafreemasyredu-by-the-end-of-the-day-feb-28">Due to me by email to wafreema@syr.edu by the end of the day, Feb 28.</h3>

<p>Here are some ideas for your presentation. Going forward, I’d like to have one or two presentations most days in class, starting the week after next.</p>

<p>Your next homework assignment, due a week from today at the beginning of class, is a proposal for your presentation. Decide what you’ll be presenting, and write a
brief description of what you plan to present. (The minimum time is 15 minutes, but I imagine many of you will want to take longer; that’s okay!) Remember, your goal
is to both demonstrate what you’ve learned and to teach us something.</p>

<p>Many of you will be showing us instruments that you play. However, you don’t have to present something you already know. Don’t be afraid to pick a topic that you’ll
have to research; I can help you do that research, and help you put together a good presentation.</p>

<p>This is, of course, not an exhaustive list – you can choose topics not listed here!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Presentations on any instrument</p>
  </li>
  <li>Presentations on acoustic peculiarities of any particular performing form. For instance: classical choirs, jazz choirs, marching bands, symphony orchestras, jazz combos, metal bands, steel drum orchestras, opera, handbell choirs… Tell us:
    <ul>
      <li>What sorts of sound does your ensemble generate?</li>
      <li>What are the challenges in making it sound good?</li>
      <li>What are the challenges in enabling the performers to perform well? What do the musicians need from their environment? For instance, why are choristers arranged on stage in the way that they are? Why do rock players use monitors?</li>
      <li>How do we meet those challenges?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human speech: how the voice works, how we pronounce different vowel and consonant sounds, and the acoustic properties
of those sounds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Differences between singing and speech: what’s involved in turning the human voice into an instrument?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Variations in the human voice itself: what separates an oktavist (“Russian bass”) from a coloratura (extremely high female singer)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Variations in human speech: how do the acoustics of different languages or different speakers differ? How do we change our speech to suit different needs? (How might a teacher change their voice speaking to one person, to a small class, or to 300 people in the auditorium?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comparison between the vocal mechanism of humans and that of animals, focusing on the connection between the anatomy and how it generates different sounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A discussion of sonar and echolocation, both passive and active, used both by animals and by machines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overview of digital music synthesis: MIDI, video game music, synthesized orchestras, and the like</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overview of analog music synthesis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detailed study of one to three synthesized pieces of music. How were they made? What technology was used? How is composing for synthesizer different from composing for real instruments?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microphones and speakers: what are they trying to do, and how do they do it? What is the goal in designing a “good” speaker system, and how is that done? Alternatively, how do you go about using microphones to record a performance, either to make a recording, or to amplify live music?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The design of concert halls and performing spaces, using one or two famous ones as examples. How should a performing space suit the sort of music being played in it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electric guitar effects: what do they actually do to the sound, and how do they do it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Digital audio compression: how do MP3, AAC, Opus, and the like work? What do you gain, and what do you lose?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historical developments in either the symphony orchestra, jazz groups, or rock bands, focusing on how instruments have changed to suit the needs of musicians</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evolution of recording technology: piano rolls, wax cylinders, and the like, up to the modern era. (There is some pretty wild stuff during the period 1950-1990, when spies were constantly coming up with new ingenious ways to eavesdrop, too, which you could mention!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ear safety: how do loud noises damage our ears, what does that damage look like, and how do we avoid it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evolution of tuning systems from the early days to the present</p>
  </li>
  <li>Connections between musical acoustics and other fields of physics, particularly quantum mechanics and atomic physics</li>
</ul>
