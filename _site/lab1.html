<ol>
  <li>Draw diagrams of the vibrational patterns for the first six harmonics of a vibrating string. Label all the nodes and antinodes, and give the wavelength $\lambda$
as a multiple of the length $L$ of the string. (For instance, the first one has a wavelength $2L$.)<br /><br />We’ve done this in class,
but drawing these pictures is trickier than it looks, so you should practice this! It’ll help you figure out the rest of the questions, too.
<br /></li>
  <li>Suppose you have such a string tuned to the note $E_4$, as in the highest string on a guitar. Label (on your diagrams) the frequencies of each of these harmonics.
<br /></li>
  <li>Remember that the wave speed is $v=\sqrt{T/\mu}$, where $T$ is the tension on the string in newtons, and $\mu$ is the linear mass density in kilograms per meter.
(Recall the relationship between wave speed, wavelength, and frequency $c=f\lambda$.)
Suppose that you have a string of length 70 centimeters and mass density $\mu=0.0004$ kg/m. If you want to tune this string to $E_4$, how much tension must you apply?
<br /></li>
  <li>The other strings on a guitar are tuned to $E_2$, $A_2$, $D_3$, $G_3$, and $B_3$. Suppose you wanted the tension on all of these strings to be the same. (If there is too much
difference in tension, it’ll twist the neck of the instrument.) This is done by using strings of different thicknesses. Calculate the required mass density of the other strings.
<br /></li>
  <li>Suppose you take the high E string ($E_4$) and “play harmonics” by touching the string lightly one-third of the way down its length while plucking it. What frequencies will be
produced? (Give the first three.) What note will you hear?
<br /></li>
  <li>Suppose that instead of plucking the string in the normal place, you pluck it exactly in its center.
    <ul>
      <li>How will this affect the strengths of the different harmonics that are produced? (You may try this and see!)</li>
      <li>What if you pluck it one-third of the way down its length?</li>
      <li>In each case, what pitch do you hear?
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try the following on a piano. You may use my digital piano for this; the effect happens just like on a real one, even though it is simulated by computer.
    <ul>
      <li>Press the key $C_4$ gently, so you’re removing the dampers from the strings, but not actually sounding the note.</li>
      <li>Play $C_3$ quickly several times, loudly. What do you hear?</li>
      <li>Repeat the following with $D_3$. Why don’t you hear anything now?</li>
      <li>Now repeat the process with $F_3$. What note do you hear? Explain why this happens.</li>
      <li>Repeat the process again with $G_4$. Again, what note do you hear? Explain what is going on.
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Listen to the recording of Jimi Hendrix playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” on electric guitar at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKvnQYFhGCc">Woodstock, 1969</a>, while you
have a spectrum analyzer running. (Hendrix starts playing at around 0:30). Listen to the first few phrases. Notice that, despite all the distortion on the guitar, you can make out 
a clear harmonic series much of the time. Now listen specifically to the phrase starting at 0:56. Hendrix plays the familiar four-note major sequence E-flat 3, G3, B-flat 3, and E-flat 4,
(“… say, can you see?”).<br /><br />
As with any ascending series of notes, you might expect to see harmonics that become more widely spaced, as the frequency of the fundamental increases. However, on the high E-flat, 
you will see many <em>lower</em> lines appear as well – lines that are most definitely not present in either E-flat 4 or the previous note, B-flat 3. This corresponds with the “grinding”
sound you hear here.<br /><br />
What is going on here? As a hint, recall what you learned about distortion in class, and consider that Hendrix may have not completely muffled the sound of the previous note.<br /><br />
Do you see this effect in “clean” electric guitar performance, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI57gu2z_Fo">this street performance of “The Sultans of Swing”</a>?
<br /></li>
  <li>Imagine tuning a guitar with the following procedure:
    <ul>
      <li>Tune the lowest string, $E_2$, to some frequency you choose</li>
      <li>Tune the next string, $A_2$, by matching the frequency of its third harmonic (which should be $E_4$) to that of the fourth harmonic of the $E_2$ string (which is thus $E_4$).</li>
      <li>Tune the $D_3$ string with the same procedure, since it is also a fourth above $A_2$</li>
      <li>Tune the $G_3$ string with the same procedure, since it is also a fourth above $G_3$</li>
      <li>If you play the $G_3$ string with your finger on the fourth fret, you will produce the note $B_3$ at a frequency $2^{4/12}$ times higher. This will let you tune the $B_3$ string.</li>
      <li>Again tune the $E_4$ string by matching the frequency of its third harmonic (which should be $B_5$) to that of the fourth harmonic of the $B_3$ string (which should be $B_5$).
<br /><br />Calculate all the frequencies involved to four significant digits. Then determine the frequency ratio between the high and low E strings, which should be 4 (two octaves).
Is it? What has gone wrong?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
